# Dynamic Documents For Computational Reproducibility

## First: can you take this quick survey please?

\Huge{https://goo.gl/oZjMCf}

## Dynamic Documents For Computational Reproducibility
- Based on principles of *literate programming* aims at combining code and paper in one single document 
- Best framework to achieve the holy grail of **one-click reproducible workflow**
- Best two current implementations: `RMarkdown (R)` & `Jupyter (Python)`. `Stata` is catching up (more at the end)

## Currently code and narrative components live in separate universes 
![](./Two universes.png)   


## Dynamic Documents: integrate the two universes!  
![](./One universe.png)

  
## Dynamic Documents: A Recipe  

- 1 simple language that can combine text and code: `Markdown` 
- 1 statistical package to do the analysis (`R`, `Python`, `3S's?`)
- 1 machinery to combine analysis and text to create a single output: `Pandoc`
- [Optional-but-not-really] 1 program to bring all the elements together: RStudio/RMarkdown, Jupyter

## Markdown laguange/syntax in 60 seconds


COMPLETET

# One Type of Dynamic Document: R Markdown

## For our excercise: R Markdown  

- `R`: **open source** programming language design for statistical analysis.   
- RStudio: free software that provides and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  
- RStudio combines all together: R + Markdown + Pandoc to produce multiple outputs

## R Markdown

## Basic Structure

- A header
- Text
- Code: inline and chunks

## Basic Structure: Header

```{r smpl yml, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
title: "Sample Paper"
author: "Fernando Hoces de la Guardia"
output: html_document
---
```  

```{r global pars, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
n.pers = 40
```  


## Basic Structure: Body of Text

```{r smpl_yml1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
header
---
```

This is where you write your paper. Nothing much to add. You can check Markdown [syntax here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). And it can use can type equations using LaTex syntax!

## Basic Structure: Code Chunks and Inline

```{r smpl_yml2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
---
header
---
```

Body of text. 


To begin a piece of code ("code chunk"). Enclose them in the following expression (Ctrl/Cmd + shift/optn + i) 

````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
here goes the code
```
````

To write inline use only one Backtick to open followed by an "r"" and one to close `` `r
1+1` `` in the output.

# Practical Excercise #1

## Hands-on excercise: the birthday problem!

As an illustration lets write a report using the participants in this workshop to illustrate the famous [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). 

>What is the probability that at least two people this room share the same birthday?

>Is it something like $\frac{1}{365} \times N =$   `r round(1/365 * n.pers, 3)`?

## Create a new RMarkdown File

1 - In RStudio: `File-> New File -> RMarkdown...`  
2 - Name it, and save it.   
3 - Review/edit the header, and delete all the default body of text except for one code chunk.   
4 - Define a seed (`set.seed = 1234` and number of people in the room (`n.pers = ?`)

## The birthday problem: the math
Actually the math says otherwise: 
\begin{align} 
 1 - \bar p(n) &= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right) \times \left(1-\frac{2}{365}\right) \times \cdots \times \left(1-\frac{n-1}{365}\right) \nonumber  \\  &= \frac{ 365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1) }{ 365^n } \nonumber \\ &= \frac{ 365! }{ 365^n (365-n)!} = \frac{n!\cdot\binom{365}{n}}{365^n}\\
p(n= `r n.pers`) &= `r  round(1 - factorial(n.pers) * choose(365,n.pers)/ 365^n.pers, 3)`  \nonumber
\end{align}

## Code for the math (<https://goo.gl/cf3w1Y>)

Don't look at this: just copy and paste into your report
```{r math, eval=FALSE}
\begin{align} 
 1 - \bar p(n) &= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right) 
 \times \left(1-\frac{2}{365}\right) \times \cdots \times 
 \left(1-\frac{n-1}{365}\right) \nonumber  \\  
 &= \frac{ 365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times 
   (365-n+1) }{ 365^n } \nonumber \\ 
 &= \frac{ 365! }{ 365^n (365-n)!} = 
   \frac{n!\cdot\binom{365}{n}}{365^n}\\
p(n= `r n.pers`) &= `r  
 round(1 - factorial(n.pers) * 
         choose(365,n.pers)/ 365^n.pers, 3)`\nonumber
\end{align}
```

## Don't like math? Let's run a simple simulation!   
 1 - Simulate 10,000 rooms with $n = `r n.pers`$ random birthdays, and store the results in matrix where each row represents a room.   
 2 - For each room (row) compute the number of unique birthdays.   
 3 - Compute the average number of times a room has `r n.pers` unique birthdays, across 10,000 simulations, and report the complement.    


## Code for the simulation (<https://goo.gl/cf3w1Y>)  

```{r birthday prob, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
birthday.prob = function(n.pers, n.sims) {
  # simulate birthdays
  birthdays = matrix(round(runif(n.pers * n.sims, 1, 365)), 
                      nrow = n.sims, ncol = n.pers)
  # for each room (row) get unique birthdays
  unique.birthdays = apply(birthdays, 1, unique)
  # Indicator with 1 if all are unique birthdays
  all.different = (lapply(unique.birthdays, length) == n.pers)
  # Compute average time all have different birthdays 
  result = 1 - mean(all.different)
return(result)
}
n.pers.param = 43
n.sims.param = 1e4
birthday.prob(n.pers.param,n.sims.param)
```


# Practical Excercise #2

## Hands-on excercise #2: DD (Diff in Diff) with DD (dynamic docs)

As an illustration lets write a report using the participants in this workshop to illustrate the famous [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). 

>What is the probability that at least two people this room share the same birthday?

>Is it something like $\frac{1}{365} \times N =$   `r round(1/365 * n.pers, 3)`?



## Results   
- Many people originally think of a prob ~ $\frac{1}{365} \times N =$   `r round(1/365 * n.pers.param, 3)`
- However the true probability is of $p(n= `r n.pers.param`) = `r round(1 - factorial(n.pers.param) * choose(365,n.pers.param)/ 365^n.pers.param, 3)`$
- And the simulated probability is of  `r birthday.prob(n.pers = n.pers.param, n.sims = n.sims.param)`

# Final Remarks & More Resources

## Final Remarks & More Resources
 - With DD with can achieve a one-click reproducible workflow.
 - This is particularly helpful to understand/present results that are hard to digest.
 - Stata just develop an internal version of DD for v15. [Review Here](https://www.bitss.org/2017/09/05/review-of-statas-dyndoc/)
 - More great examples [here](https://github.com/BITSS/Annual2017/tree/master/3-Rmarkdown)
 - Want to learn more: [great free books](https://bookdown.org/) (can you guess how they were written?)
